     - Performance was analyzed using SaaF tools to optimize system efficiency.
   - Technologies: AWS, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ
   - GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/louisjohn14/FilterForge]

2. **[Cryptographic Library and Application](https://github.com/louisjohn14/CryptographicLibraryAndApp)**
   - Description: Created a Java-based cryptographic library that implements secure message encryption using advanced cryptographic algorithms.
     - The project involved building input-output file handling for encrypted communication and applying Object-Oriented Design patterns for clean and maintainable code.
   - Technologies: IntelliJ
